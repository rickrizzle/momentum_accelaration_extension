#Copycat Project of Momemtum Chrome Browser Extension

This is my first project made with AngularJs.

The main requirements for this project are as follows:

1. Display high-quality images as the background that change each time the browser reloads.
2. Display the current time.
3. Display greeting appropropriate to the time of day.

By the end this project will also feature:

- A mini To-Do list
- Local weather and temp
- Ask you for your name and location to personalize the greeting and give accurate weather, temperature, and time.
- Include rotating quotations.
- Ask you what your goal for the day is.

These are all features in the real Momemtum and I look forward to implementing them in my own version of one of my favorite apps.
